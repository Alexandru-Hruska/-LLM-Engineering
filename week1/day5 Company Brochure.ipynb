      "submitted our response to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy's request for information on the AI Action Plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our response (myself, coauthored with\n",
      "Yacine Jernite\n",
      "and\n",
      "Irene Solaiman\n",
      "), the overarching message is the following: Open AI systems and open science are fundamental to creating technology that is more performant, efficiently adopted, and secure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our recommendations are centered on three interconnected pillars:\n",
      "\n",
      "1️⃣ Recognize Open Source and Open Science as Fundamental to AI Success: \n",
      "The most advanced AI systems today stand on foundations of open research and software. Research has shown that investment in open systems have a strong economic multiplier effect. We need continued investment in public research infrastructure, compute access, and trusted open datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "2️⃣ Prioritize Efficiency and Reliability to Unlock Broad Innovation:\n",
      "Smaller, efficient models enable wider adoption across organizations with varying resources. Purpose-designed AI supports better in-context evaluation and resource utilization. This approach is especially critical in high-risk settings like healthcare.\n",
      "\n",
      "3️⃣ Secure AI through Open, Traceable, and Transparent Systems:\n",
      "Information security history shows that open, transparent systems are essential for security. Different levels of openness can address various security requirements. Open-weight models that can run in air-gapped environments help manage information risks.\n",
